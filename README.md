# Boolario

## Description
Boolario is a Mario parody minigame that uses Unity to teach others about game development concepts in a 2D game, such as graphical design, scripting in C#, and hitboxes.  In this program, students will learn about boolean statements by collecting TRUE and FALSE coins to make a logic statement correct.  This program is intented to increase interest in coding and game development by allowing students the opportunity to put their creations into practice as well as share them with others.

The world of technology is developing at an intense rate. As students of the future are increasingly learning, computer science becomes more relevant every day. That being said, TAP (Technology Ambassador Program) provides the opportunity to inspire others in the field of Information Technology.

Our team has developed a project which takes the form of an educational computer game.  We are hoping to teach logic statements in the gameplay to a large audience with various backgrounds. The Best TAP Group would like to introduce to you: Boolario.
This project is a side-scroller-type game, similar to Mario, in which we teach the concept of booleans. Our game focuses on how certain statements such as 'AND' and 'OR' can affect these booleans. In order to achieve this, a coin collecting system is in place to demonstrate the process. There are two coins: a false and a true coin. By creating a goal of TRUE or FALSE on the UI, the player has to collect a set of 2 coins to make the statement correct. 

Our workshop goals consist of introducing concepts of game development to our audience; explaining the fundamentals of logic statements; discussing iteration and randomization; and of course, booleans. The biggest challenge posed to our team thus far is how to effectively host this workshop in person and online. We have recognized several potential approaches. Our team is very excited for the opportunity to build this p

## Outreach Activities
1. Super Saturday Series (S3), Nov 9, Georgia Gwinnett College = middle and high school girls to promote IT and STEM career
2. TAP Expo, Oct 10, 2021, Georgia Gwinnett College - To promote IT field and the TAP program to college students 
3. Class Workshops - on [dates TBA] to promote IT field to non-IT college students

## Technology
For this program, our team used [Makey Makey](https://unity.com/), a device that changes a conductor into a source of computer input, and [Unity](https://makeymakey.com/), a 2D and 3D game engine.
