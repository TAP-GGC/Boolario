# Boolario

# Description
Boolario is a Mario parody minigame that uses Unity to teach others about game development concepts in a 2D game, such as graphical design, scripting in C#, and hitboxes.  In this program, students will learn about boolean statements by collecting TRUE and FALSE coins to make a logic statement correct.  This program is intented to increase interest in coding and game development by allowing students the opportunity to put their creations into practice as well as share them with others.
